## 🚀 Project Highlights

### 📊 Defect Detection Model (In Progress)
Developed a machine learning model that helps detect product defects from images-- automating a task traditionally done by human inspectors.  
This project uses Python and computer vision tools to classify defects, aiming to reduce inspection time and improve accuracy.
Currently refining the model and designing a dashboard to visualize results in real time.
- **Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, OpenCV, Jupyter  
- **Techniques**: Classification, image preprocessing, model evaluation  
- **Goal**: Reduce inspection time and improve quality control accuracy  
- **Status**: Currently improving model efficiency and developing a dashboard for real-time insights
